# UT-GenoRNGSimulator
Scripts to simulate genocide RNG and output speedrun times for Undertale.

A guide on the scripts listed here:

* Geno.py = The main script, meant to calculate the entire Geno run. Only Ruins is somewhat accurate, you can toggle the areas you want to include.
* NeutralRuins.py = A bonus script to calculate the neutral ruins, though it may not be very accurate
* AllPossibilitiesRuins.py = A script that gets all the possible ruins encounters instead of doing random simulations. For some reason, this does not coincide perfectly with the main ruins simulator, so I would not trust either until someone finds out why.
* Extra = Most of these are old versions with minor adjustments, I don't recommend using them unless you know what you are doing.
